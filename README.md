# Textsteganography
Textstaganography(Cryptography project):This type of steganography include the  modification of the layout of a text, rules like using every nth  character or the altering of the amount of white space after lines or  between words. Another possible way of storing a secret inside a  text is using a publicly available cover source, a book or a  newspaper, and using a code which consists for example of a  combination of a page number, a line number and a character  number. This way, no information stored inside the cover source will  lead to the hidden message. Discovering it relies solely on gaining  knowledge of the secret key.
